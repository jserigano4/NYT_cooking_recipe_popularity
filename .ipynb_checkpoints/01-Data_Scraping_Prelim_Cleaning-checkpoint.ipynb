    "- Gather and prepare URLs of [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/) recipes using an [XML Sitemap creator](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/).\n",
    "- Scrape recipe data from 10,000 posts using web scraping tool [recipe_scrapers](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers) found on Github.\n",
    "- Format recipe data into a DataFrame and save for EDA and preprocessing analysis. \n",

    "The main question we are trying to answer is: **What characteristics of a recipe are most likely to increase the popularity (and overall site traffic), and what changes can be made to increase recipe popularity before posting?**"
